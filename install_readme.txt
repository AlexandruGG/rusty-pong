Hello, thank you for interest in Rusty Pong!

Requirements:
- macOS
- Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL 2.0) installed on the system - https://www.libsdl.org/index.php

Steps:
1. run ./install for a smooth setup process
2. run ./pong to play the game

Please note that linux is not supported (needs compiling), even though the ./install script has that as an option!
